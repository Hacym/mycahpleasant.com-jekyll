<p>I'm originally from Florida and am a proud graduate of the University of Florida (Go Gators! &#x1F40A;). Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at The Georgia Institute of Technology. I should be finishing that up by 2021.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy writing, hiking, music, and am an avid sports fan. Technology is my first passion, but, in another life, I swear I was a chef, so I love to cook and eat. If I had to do it all over, that's the only other job I think I could tolerate.</p>
<p>Based out of Atlanta, I currently work as a software development consultant at a private firm. My primary focus is web development. I'm not looking to take on any more professional work right now, but, if you have a fun project you'd like to collaborate on, shoot me an email at mycah [at] mycahpleasant [dot] com.</p>
<p>You can find my current personal projects, as well as my up to date resume on my <a href="https://github.com/hacym" target="_blank">Github</a> page. My academic work is available upon request from an appropriate source.</a>
